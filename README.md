## Overview

This project uses the [UCI Sentiment Labelled Sentences dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/331/sentiment+labelled+sentences) to classify short customer reviews from Yelp, Amazon, and IMDB. The final application lets users input a sentence and instantly receive a **predicted sentiment** with model confidence.

## üí° Key Features

- Cleaned and explored labeled customer reviews (positive/negative)
- Trained and evaluated multiple models:
  - Logistic Regression ‚úÖ (final model)
  - Multinomial Naive Bayes
  - Random Forest
- Visualized performance using bar plots
- Created word clouds for each sentiment class
- Built a simple and intuitive Streamlit app for real-time predictions

## Model Performance

| Model                   | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|------------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression    | 0.836    | 0.837     | 0.818  | 0.828    |
| Multinomial Naive Bayes| 0.829    | 0.799     | 0.860  | 0.828    |
| Random Forest          | 0.809    | 0.833     | 0.754  | 0.791    |

Logistic Regression was chosen for deployment due to its balanced and reliable performance across all metrics.

## Dataset

- Source: [UCI Sentiment Labelled Sentences dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/331/sentiment+labelled+sentences)
- Size: 2,748 sentences across Yelp, Amazon, and IMDB
- Labels: 1 (positive), 0 (negative)

### Sample Predictions

```text
Sentence: "Absolutely terrible experience, never buying again."
Predicted Sentiment: Negative (0.95 confidence)

Sentence: "Customer service was quick and helpful."
Predicted Sentiment: Positive (0.92 confidence)
```

## Project Summary

This project demonstrates how a simple yet powerful machine learning pipeline can be used to extract insights from customer feedback. It combines text preprocessing, model evaluation, and deployment‚Äîall in one place.

## ‚ú® Future Improvements

- Explore advanced models like DistilBERT or BERT
- Expand the dataset with more domain-specific reviews
- Add explanations for predictions using tools like LIME or SHAP
- Deploy on the web using Streamlit Community Cloud

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to UCI for providing a clean and simple dataset to work with. The project was created as part of a data science portfolio to demonstrate NLP and deployment capabilities.
